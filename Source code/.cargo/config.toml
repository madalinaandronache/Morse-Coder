# Cross-compiling for the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 requires the thumbv8m.main-none-eabihf triple. It tells the compiler to build code for:
#   * the ARMv8-M Mainline (thumbv8m.main) architecture
#   * that runs bare metal, without an operating system available (none)
#   * uses the Embedded Application Binary Interface (eabi) with hardware floating point support (hf)
