# Morse Coder

**Morse Coder** is a Rust-based embedded system that converts typed text into Morse code using a Raspberry Pi Pico 2W. 
The user enters text through a 4x4 matrix keypad, which is then translated into Morse code and transmitted via:

* Sound signals (buzzer)
* Light signals (LEDs)
* Visual display (LCD screen using dots and dashes)

The goal is to provide a compact and intuitive system for encoding and visualizing Morse messages using embedded Rust.  
The project required around **60 hours** of hands-on development, from initial hardware setup to final software testing and documentation.

## Functionality Description

The user types a message using a 4x4 matrix keypad with multitap logic. The system translates each confirmed 
character into Morse code. The Morse code output is:
* Played through a buzzer (short/long beeps)
* Visualized with LEDs (dot = 1 LED, dash = 3 LEDs)
* Shown on an I2C LCD screen using dots (.) and dashes (-)

Additional functionality includes:

Additional features:
- Predefined commands to send **HELLO** and **SOS**
- Displaying **fun facts** on screen
- A **Morse code quiz mode**

## Requirments

### Hardware

| Component | Purpose | Function |
|:----------|:--------|:---------|
| **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W** | Main controller of the system | Reads input text, processes it, and controls outputs to buzzer, LEDs, and LCD |
| **4x4 Matrix Keypad** | Provides text input | Acts as the input device for entering characters |
| **Active Buzzer** | Outputs Morse code through sound | Emits short and long beeps representing dots and dashes |
| **LEDs** x 3 | Visual representation of Morse code signals | - When a dot (.) is detected, only **one LED** lights up (the middle one).<br/>- When a dash (_) is detected, **all three LEDs** light up simultaneously. |
| **LCD Display** | Displays the Morse code translation | Shows real-time dot and dash output |
| **Breadboard + Jumper Wires** | Temporary prototyping connections | Connects components to the Raspberry Pi Pico during development |

### Software

- **Rust** with `thumbv6m-none-eabi` target
- **Embassy** async embedded framework
- `probe-rs` or `cargo-embed` for flashing code
- See dependencies in the table below

## Hardware & Software Design

### System Arhitecture

The following diagram shows the system architecture:

![System Architecture Diagram](./Images/diagram.png)

The **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W** acts as the brain of the system, coordinating all interactions between input and output components.

- The **4x4 matrix keypad** provides the user input.
- The **Pico** processes the text and converts it into Morse code.
- The **LEDs** and **buzzer** output the corresponding Morse signals.
- The **LCD screen** displays the Morse code in real time using dots (.) and dashes (_).

### Keypad Interface Design

![Keypad Diagram](./Images/keypad.jpg)

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| `HELLO` | Sends `HELLO` in Morse |
| `S.O.S.` | Sends SOS sequence |
| `DEMO` | Quiz mode (guess the letter) |
| `FUN FACTS` | Shows trivia |
| `MODE` | Switches text/number input |
| `TEST ALL` | Sends full message buffer |

### Software Flow

![Software Flow Diagram](./Images/software_flow.webp)

The software operates in a continuous loop, monitoring keypad input. When a key is pressed, the program first checks whether it is a special key (such as HELLO, S.O.S., FUN FACTS, DEMO, or TEST ALL). If so, it executes the corresponding function: displaying or transmitting predefined Morse code sequences, showing a fun fact, playing a Morse quiz, or sending the entire message typed so far. If the key is not a special command, the program proceeds to check the current input modeâ€”Text or Numeric. In Text mode, multitap logic is used to determine the intended character, while in Numeric mode digits are added directly. After a one-second pause without further taps, the current character is confirmed, added to a message buffer, and its Morse code is displayed and played. The system then returns to listening for the next key input.
